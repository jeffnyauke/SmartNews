# SmartNews

**SmartNews** is a sample news Android application where users are able to view the latest news articles from the comfort of their homes. The app is built to demonstrate use of *Modern Android development* tools.

***You can Install and test latest SmartNews app from [here](https://github.com/jeffnyauke/SmartNews/releases/latest/download/app.apk)***

## Features
It simply loads **News Articles** from [API](https://smartapplications.free.beeceptor.com/feed) and stores it in persistence storage (i.e. SQLite Database). Posts will be always loaded from local database. Remote data (from API) and Local data is always synchronized.
- The homepage contains a listing of the news articles. It displays the title, image and a bit of the description
- Upon clicking an article, the user is redirected to a screen displaying the full article description, together with the title and image
- After the app fetches the articles, it stores them locally for offline viewing
